        The brothers, they were two. Inseparable as well.<br>
        They strode around and played with gravity wells.<br>
        They were told to leave the wells alone, to stay away and out.<br>
        But they were kids, they were curious, and knew none about.<br>
        <br>
        Each day, they went, and threw everything they could gather.<br>
        Ki fruits, Starseeds, Pulsar Radiation and dark matter.<br>
        Thwop! The wells did, with such greed swallowing it all. <br>
        And when his brother wasn't looking, Mithrix threw worms.<br>
        <br>
        They had made a pact each other to not throw life.<br>
        As everything else around them was incredibly rife.<br>
        His brother loved worms, and it'd tear at his soul.<br>
        But Mithrix, in his mind, didn't care about worms at all.<br>
        Thwop! The wells did. Swallowing worms without effort.<br>
        And Mithrix watching, he felt something pleasant.<br>
        His cutiosity sated, but his mind still felt empty.<br>
        So Mithrix would do it again, as worms there were plenty.<br>
        <br>
        That day, he went, and threw all the worms he could gather.<br>
        Thwop! The wells did, swallowing with no doubt or rather. <br>
        Mithrix made sure his brother wasn't there when he threw worms.<br>
        But that day, he was watching. And his brother loved worms.<br>
        <br>
        His brother saw it all, Mithrix breaking the pact.<br>
        With quiet rage, he stormed away at the drop of a hat.<br>
        In his rage, he told Her about how Mithrix started throwing worms.<br>
        But he forgot that they shouldn't be near the gravity wells foremost.
        </p>
        <p>
        Then time passed, the brothers were kids no more, they were adults, and figured out more ways to entertain themselves.
        Mithrix spent his time admiring designs of places, as well as finding new corners of their homeworld, while his brother spent his time looking out after the creatures of their world.
        They had both made teleporters, to travel around their home faster. They figured out the key elements of what their reality is based, and toyed around with them.

            I've begun to understand our universe. The compounds that drive reality here. I've prepared a demonstration - come look, brother!<br>
            Now, look here. It's got presence and weight. Round, with no features. No orientation. It is mass. Almost everything here is mass. Mass is boring, but required.<br>
            We can take mass - and shape it to form. Features, angles, and intent. Look at the planarity of the surfaces. This is design. I love design.<br>
            Now, a volatile one - a lifeline. Blood. Sharp, yet radiant. Blood is heat. This is my blood, but there is plenty of blood in this universe. <br>
            Now be gentle. Look closely here. Do you see it? Almost invisible, a thin film. Frail. It's not in this reality, but an adjacent one.<br>
            I've heard you discuss this - something you innately understood. What you describe as soul. Don't you love soul?<br>
            <br>
            Do you understand? It's your turn, brother! I've simply found the compounds. It is your hands that must craft value from them.

        From there, the brothers took to shaping their world. They had made lands and landscapes, they had made guardians, they had made constructs, they had made teleporters.
        Mithrix enjoyed making designs for the landscapes, he relished in the vanity, the complexity, the intricate beauty of it. While his brother, oh, his brother; he merely enjoyed the soul, not the design.
        So Mithrix took to designing while his brother was tasked to give them life. But the completions that his brother made Mithrix uneasy, and so he took it to himself to teach him.
        But his brother loved soul.

            Your completions of my designs are uneasy, brother. Let me show you their purpose.<br>
            We begin with stone, silver, and fire. Take note of the ratios.<br><br>
            High speed. Speed is war. <br>
            Twin cannons - with twin exhausts. We stream their exhausts, for volatility.<br>
            Quadrupeds are easier, and more stable. We maintain that.<br>
            And that, dear brother, is it. No dance. No song. These guardians do not need soul.<br><br>
            <br>
            Brother, what is this...? Why is it misshapen and weak? Was there an error in my design?<br>
            Guardian. Come to me. Allow me to see your construction.<br>
            ...<br>
            So I see.
            These are not the correct ratios.<br><br>
            This is no minor error, Brother. You have purposefully deviated from the design. For what purpose have you done this? You cannot weave a construct from such an abundance of soul.
            You know it is too unstable - that it is too unpredictable and too frail.<br><br>
            I have told you this, and yet you have wasted the materials I have gathered - and exhausted your own strength to fabricate this miscreation.
            To what benefit?<br><br>At its best, it can be no more than an inferior servant; it is deficient in the compounds that were to give it fortitude and strength. At its worst, it will betray us.<br><br>
            You have created the first being of this world which threatens us. We cannot keep it here. <br><br>
            Attempting to destroy it will risk its retaliation... I will prepare one of the vaults for it to be sealed away, while it is still young and naive.<br>
            What a foolish mistake you have made, brother.<br><br>
            I expect you to return the design to me. I cannot allow you to build another construct with so much power - and with such little control. <br><br>
            I will build the rest of our guardians; by my hand, they will be weak, but at least they will be loyal.<br>
            Go home. I will deal with this creature. We can discuss a better project for you when I return.<br>

            Eventually, the brothers decided it woild be time to leave the planet and aim for the cosmos, but they couldn't get too far before succumbing to space. They tried using their teleporters, but the attempts failed.
            Mithrix, was determined. As he had hope, hope that if he crossed the sea of stars maybe then they could find more of their kind. Hope that maybe then, they would reunite with her.
            But his brother, oh, his brother; he did not care about that. He only cared about soul.

            My brother, it is done. Come! see!<br><br>
            Look to the moon... the first beacon shines brightly on the other side! There was no gap in its sequence - it has traveled instantaneously.
            We can cross the dark sea without succumbing to its sickness if we simply do not travel through it at all - is it not a brilliant light of hope? <br>
            Only your hands could have realized my design, brother. I feel truly now that there is no obstacle nor force we cannot overcome together - with my designs, and your constructions.
            While it pains me to see your heart still torn for the doomed, we are not among them. There is an entire cosmos for us. We can escape this planet. Our prison.<br>
            If your heart truly yearns to save... then surely more of our kind awaits among the other worlds - trapped by the dark sea.<br><br>
            And to them we can offer the gates.<br><br>
            When next she visits our world I must ask her to take a gate with her. Perhaps dozens! You should be celebrating with me, brother!<br><br>
            ... And yet I see your somber gaze will not lift. Please, take the gate. Step foot on another world. Reap the rewards of your toil.<br>
            Prove to the universe you are free! I cannot bear to see you in such a pitiable mood on such a joyous occasion.<br><br>
            ...<br><br>
            If you insist, brother, I will go first. Forget about those creatures - and do not dawdle. I want to see joy on your face.<br>

        Once Mithrix stepped into the teleporter, he warped away, away to the moon of their planet. Once he arrived, his brother, his treacherous brother, changed the alignment of the teleporter to reflect it back on the planet.
        Mithrix stepped out, and when he arrived, he waited. And waited. Mithrix started building constructs, designing the moon as he waited for his brother. And he waited.<br>And waited. <br>And waited. <br>
        Then, he realized. He couldn't return back. Mithrix looked into the planet. His brother wasn't coming. His brother had made his choice. His brother had chosen the worms, the vermin that were on the planet, vermin that were on OTHER planets, over him. This infuriated Mithrix.
        It did so greatly.

            A wretched carnival. They were doomed for good reason.<br><br>
            Dunepeople of Aphelia: lost, in fanatic worship of parasitic influences.<br>Lemurians: destined to a dead planet, picked clean.<br>Chitin beasts. Automations of death. Why do you bring them home? They were not meant to survive.<br>
            I have watched you for ages, from my dead rock - and every century, you disgust me with vanity.<br>You invite vermin into your home. Wretches. Rats. Monsters. Creatures without restraint. Each and every one, planet killers.<br>And yet, you entertain them as guests. Like children, requiring saving and protection.<br><br>
            She should have died for me. Her gift was wasted on you.<br><br>
            And when will we open discussion - dear brother - of all your thin lies? Why do you forbid your guests to leave? To pilot?<br>Why do you fashion great walls and gates? Why do you weave constructs of destruction, if your role is protection?<br>They are entries in your collection. You slaver. Gatekeeper. Hoarder.<br><br>
            Your death is fated. When you die - and you WILL die - I will be ready. I have been patient for millennia. That planet... is mine.
